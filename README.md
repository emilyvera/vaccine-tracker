## About:
The COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker is a visual method for viewing COVID-19 safety ratings by city. 
The data is organized via a map. The map displays color-coded pins representing the safety rating based on the city's percentage of the population vaccinated. 
This application is aimed towards travelers who want to make informed decisions about where to travel to safely post-pandemic.
